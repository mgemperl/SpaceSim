Worklog

2014_06_16: 
- Implemented and somewhat optimized detections of projectile hits
- Worked on targeting

2014_06_22:
- Worked more on targeting; sectors now store ordered sets of their occupants instead of unordered lists
- Fixed bugs caused by my work on targeting
- Further optimized projectiles' collision detection algorithm

2014_06_23:
- Got targeting working for the player and the AI
- Implemented an ugly version of dust so that the player knows where he or she is moving

2014_06_26:
- Implemented firing arcs and aim assist for projectile weapons
- Started working to improve movement AI, but it got really screwy so I'm giving up for now

2014_06_30:
- Optimized how vectors are handled in the program so that it no longer does the expensive magnitude computation when unnecessary.
- Fixed aiming bug introduced while implementing firing arcs and aim assist for projectile weapons. I love that high you get after solving a tough problem.
- Improved AI tracking and prediction of vessel movement in aiming, though it still can't deal well with acceleration
- Improved how the AI maneuvers
- Fixed targeting bug that caused you to just switch between the first two enemy ships

2014_07_01:
- Improved AI tactics -- they shoot while breaking now
- Improved targeting for player and AI --   added commands to find best target and to untarget

2014_07_09:
- Worked on finding a way to make a good GUI in a reasonable length of time
- Began reorganizing the implementation of the ship AI
- Worked on using xml files to store definitions and game state

2014_08_02:
- Massive restructuring of the general implementation; decided to go for a more M&B style gameplay
- Added stars in the background

2014_08_03:
- Worked on improving the weapon slots on ships
- Turreted weapons are in!

2014_08_05:
- Finally got guided weapons working right
- Made some improvements in my "CONST-CORRECTNESS"

2015_02_08:
- Switched to Direct3D to take advantage of sprites and rebuilt much of the engine architecture for better modularity and for better input and graphics capability
- Finally got basic sprites to be drawn to the screen, and even had them slowly rotate around - the framerate is looking good
- Started working on porting my previous work to the new engine architecture
- Also decided to switch back to a gameplay style closer to Escape Velocity

2015_02_16
- Finished porting pretty much all code from my old engine (except guided projectiles, but that won't be too hard)
- Added the background for sectors

2015_03_17
- Improved collision detection to use polygons instead of ellipses (still doesn't always detect collision for some reason)
- Restructuring the implementation of projectiles to make guided projectiles easier to implement
- Changing vessels and fleets to use new Controller objects instead of just an ai state -- should help separate distinct code 

next:
- Fix collision detection, has some occasional false negatives
- Modify projectiles to use the Damager interface and override method for checking collision to work around the cast in Sector
- Add Component abstract class to manage the position of components on vessels (have weaponslot extend it)

2015_04_04
- Attempted to implement an actual separating axis algorithm (I wasn't before) but now it doesn't seem detect collision at all

next:
- Fix collision detection
- see 2015_03_17

2015_04_09
- Made a separate Clock class for handling the time; should make it more portable
- Changed the Message Dispatcher class to work with time instead of ticks

next: 
- Fix collision detection (still)
- Come up with good way to implement guided projectiles

2015_04_10
- Finally got collision detection working right, but it could still use some optimization 
- Also got guided projectiles working again

next:
- Start working on some gui and hud code
- Fleet formations and sector entry/exit warp would be neat

2015_04_11
- Implemented a line-drawing class, starting on a polygon drawing class (maybe have line extend it)
- Improved guided projectile homing, still could use some work though

2015_04_12
- Further improved guided projectile homing, but need to fix the "jiggle" bug

2015_04_13
- Started working on UI code
